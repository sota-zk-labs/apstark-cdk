# Apstark Kurtosis Package

A [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) package that deploys a private, portable, and
modular [Apstark](https://github.com/sota-zk-labs/apstark) devnet over [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

Specifically, this package will deploy:

1. A local L1 Aptos chain.
2. A local L2 Madara chain, with customizable components such as sequencer, sequence sender, aggregator, rpc, prover, dac, etc. It will
   first deploy the [Verifier smart contract](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/zkevm-contracts) on the Aptos chain before
   deploying the different components.
5. [Additional services](docs/additional-services.md) such as monitoring tools, etc.

> ðŸš¨ This package is currently designed as a **development tool** for testing configurations and scenarios.
**It is not recommended for long-running or production environments such as testnets or mainnet**.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To begin, you will need to
install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (>= [v4.27.0](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4270) for Mac users)
and [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/).

If you intend to interact with and debug the stack, you may also want to consider a few additional optional tools such as:

- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq)
- [yq](https://pypi.org/project/yq/) (v3)
- [sncast](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html)

### Deploy

Once that is good and installed on your system, you can run the following command to deploy the complete stack locally. The default
deployment includes ..., ... as the sequencer, and ... This process typically takes around eight to ten minutes.

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
kurtosis run --enclave apstark-v1 --args-file params.yml .
```

Changing the configs:

```bash
yq -Y --in-place '.smth = false' params.yml
yq -Y --in-place '.args.sequencer_type = "zkevm"' params.yml
kurtosis run --enclave apstark-v1 --args-file params.yml .
```

### Interact

Let's do a simple L2 RPC test call.

First, you will need to figure out which port Kurtosis is using for the RPC. You can get a general feel for the entire network layout
by running the following command:

```bash
kurtosis enclave inspect apstark-v1
```

That output, while quite useful, might also be a little overwhelming. Let's store the RPC URL in an environment variable.

```bash
export ETH_RPC_URL="$(kurtosis port print apstark-v1 smth rpc)"
```

That is the same environment variable that `sncast` uses, so you should now be able to run this command. Note that the steps below will
assume you have the [Foundry toolchain](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed.

```bash
cast block-number
```

By default, the CDK is configured in `test` mode, which means there is some pre-funded value in the admin account with address
`0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970`.

```bash
cast balance --ether 0xE34aaF64b29273B7D567FCFc40544c014EEe9970
```

Okay, letâ€™s send some transactions...

```bash
export PK="0x12d7de8621a77640c9241b2595ba78ce443d05e94090365ab3bb5e19df82c625"
cast send --legacy --private-key "$PK" --value 0.01ether 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Okay, letâ€™s send even more transactions... Note that this step will assume you
have [polygon-cli](https://github.com/maticnetwork/polygon-cli) installed.

```bash
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$PK" --verbosity 700 --requests 50000 --rate-limit 50 --concurrency 5 --mode t
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$PK" --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 10 --mode 2
polycli loadtest --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC_URL" --legacy --private-key "$PK" --verbosity 700 --requests 500 --rate-limit 3  --mode uniswapv3
```

Pretty often, you will want to check the output from the service. Here is how you can grab some logs:

```bash
kurtosis service logs apstark-v1 agglayer --follow
```

In other cases, if you see an error, you might want to get a shell in the service to be able to poke around.

```bash
kurtosis service shell apstark-v1 contracts-001
jq . /opt/zkevm/combined.json
```

One of the most common ways to check the status of the system is to make sure that batches are going through the normal progression
of [trusted, virtual, and verified](https://docs.polygon.technology/cdk/concepts/transaction-finality/):

```bash
cast rpc zkevm_batchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_virtualBatchNumber
cast rpc zkevm_verifiedBatchNumber
```

If the number of verified batches is increasing, then it means the system works properly.

To access the `zkevm-bridge` user interface, open this URL in your web browser.

```bash
open "$(kurtosis port print apstark-v1 zkevm-bridge-proxy-001 web-ui)"
```

When everything is done, you might want to clean up with this command which stops the local devnet and deletes it.

```bash
kurtosis clean --all
```
