# For testing, follow these steps:
# 1. kurtosis clean --all (clear existing resources)
# 2. update PGPASSWORD, PGUSER, and PGHOST params per your use case (modify configs)
# 3. run ./scripts/reset_postgres.sh (drop/recreate dbs and permissions)
# 4. kurtosis run --enclave cdk-v1 --args-file params.yml . (deploy with fresh dbs)
